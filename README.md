UI Design Reflection:
We recognize and value the thoughtful considerations made in altering the user interface's color 
scheme to a soothing blue tone. Transitioning away from the starkness of black to a lighter hue 
aims to foster a more comfortable and welcoming user experience, aligning well with best practices 
in UI design. Ensuring coherence between the app's color style and its template demonstrates a commitment 
to visual consistency, which is paramount for user engagement. Furthermore, harmonizing button images 
with the background color enhances the overall aesthetic appeal and reinforces a sense of unity throughout 
the interface. The addition of two arrows on the 'convert time' button enhances its intuitiveness, 
facilitating a more seamless user interaction and improving the overall user experience. 
These meticulous adjustments not only prioritize user comfort but also uphold the app's aesthetic integrity,
ultimately contributing to a more satisfying user journey without compromising functionality or navigation.





Test the app:
To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the app's results across various scenarios, comprehensive testing 
methodologies were employed. We conducted rigorous testing using a range of devices within emulators, 
scrutinizing both functional and design elements to verify their performance and consistency. 
Additionally, thorough examination of edge cases was prioritized, encompassing scenarios that could potentially 
trigger warnings or errors. By systematically testing across multiple platforms and meticulously examining diverse 
use cases, we aimed to validate the app's functionality and ensure its ability to deliver accurate results under varying conditions.

Most Challenging:

The most challenging aspect of this assignment lies in navigating the complexities of UI design without expertise in HCI 
principles. Without a clear understanding of optimal styles for a user-friendly interface, such as selecting the most 
suitable colors and fonts, the design process becomes considerably more challenging. Additionally, incorporating shared 
preferences for the first time presents a steep learning curve, as it requires us to ensure seamless integration of 
functional and design elements while adhering to best practices. Despite these challenges, the opportunity to delve 
into new areas of development presents valuable learning experiences that contribute to our growth as developers.
